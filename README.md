## Description
- I created a simple 2D particle system using Python and PyGame.
- The particle system is created and updated at the mouse position.
- The particles are simply polygons, so changing some parameters such as poly count, polygon radius, and polygon color can create a lot of randomizations.
- Since we have a polygon we can create triangles (3 poly count), squares (4 poly count), and even more geometrical shapes easily. Increasing the poly count to a relatively bigger number like 10-15 will give a circle-like shape.
- Besides these, you can also set polygon velocity and lifetime to create different types of particle systems.
  
## How to Run?
- Download the repo to your computer.
- Run the DynamicParticleSystem.py script.
